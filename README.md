## Malware Classification with AWS SageMaker:
This repository contains the implementation for deploying a malware classification model using AWS SageMaker. The model is trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset and deployed as an API endpoint on SageMaker. Additionally, a Python client is provided to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the deployed endpoint.

Introduction
Malware detection is crucial for ensuring the security of computer systems. This project focuses on deploying a machine learning model trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset to classify executable files as either benign or malicious. The model is deployed as an API endpoint on AWS SageMaker, providing a scalable and reliable solution for malware classification.

## Setup
To replicate the deployment and usage of the model, follow these steps:
1:Clone the Repository:
 git clone 
2:Install Dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
Deploy Model on SageMaker:
Follow the instructions in deploy_model.ipynb to deploy the trained model on AWS SageMaker.
Usage:
Once the model is deployed, you can use the provided Python client to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the SageMaker endpoint.
Benchmarking
To evaluate the performance of the deployed model, 100 malware and 100 benign samples were randomly selected from the EMBER 2018 dataset. The classification results are summarized below:

## Malware Samples:
